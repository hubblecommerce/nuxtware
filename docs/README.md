Example instruction for updating documentation:

I've made some changes to the project since we last spoke. Please review the current state of the codebase and update the documentation in the /docs directory to reflect these changes. Specifically, we've [brief description of changes, e.g., 'added new components for user profiles' or 'implemented a new authorization system']. Make sure the documentation accurately reflects our current standards, workflows, and project structure.
```

For specific file updates:
