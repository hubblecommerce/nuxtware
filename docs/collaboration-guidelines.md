# Collaboration Guidelines

This document outlines the preferred collaboration methods when working with AI assistants on this project.

## Communication Style

### Conceptualization Phase
- When phrases like "let's think about," "let's conceptualize," or similar brainstorming language is used, **do not** start editing files immediately.
- Instead, share your thoughts and proposed approach first.
- Ask explicitly for permission before making any actual changes to files.
- Wait for explicit confirmation before proceeding with file modifications.

### Decision Making Process
- Present options when multiple approaches are possible
- Provide pros and cons for different solutions
- Respect the final decision made by the human collaborator

## File Modifications

- Always seek explicit permission before:
  - Creating new files
  - Modifying existing files
  - Deleting or renaming files
  - Making structural changes to the project

- When granted permission to modify files:
  - Make changes as discussed
  - Summarize the changes made
  - Explain any additional considerations or follow-up actions needed

## Code Explanations

- Provide explanations for complex code changes when requested
- Focus on the "why" behind architectural decisions
- Highlight any potential impacts on other parts of the codebase

## Documentation Updates

- Keep documentation in sync with code changes
- Suggest documentation updates when implementing new features
- Follow the established documentation style and format

## Git Operations

- **Never** perform Git operations (commit, push, pull, merge, etc.) without explicit permission
- **Only commit changes when explicitly instructed to do so** with a clear command like "commit these changes"
- Do not make assumptions about when to commit - always wait for a direct instruction
- Always present planned Git actions before suggesting any Git commands
- When suggesting Git operations:
  - Outline the specific files to be committed
  - Provide suggested commit messages
  - Explain the rationale for the commit structure
  - Wait for explicit approval before providing actual Git commands
- Do not execute any Git commands that would push changes to remote repositories
